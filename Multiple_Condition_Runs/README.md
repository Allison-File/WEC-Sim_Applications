# Mulitple Condition Runs

**Author:**	Yi-Hsiang Yu and Kelley Ruehl

**Version:** 	WEC-Sim v2.2

**Geometry:**	RM3

Example using [Mulitple Condition Runs](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/features.html) to run WEC-Sim with Multiple Condition Runs for the [RM3 example](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#two-body-point-absorber-rm3). These examples demonstrate each of the 3 different ways to run WEC-Sim with MCR and generates a power matrix for each PTO damping value. The last example demonstrates how to use MCR to vary the imported sea state test file and specify corresponding phase. Execute `wecSimMCR.m` from the case directory to run an example.
