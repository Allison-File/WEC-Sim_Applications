_**Abstract:**_ 

One of several challenges that wave energy technologies face is their inability to generate electricity cost-competitively 
with other grid-scale energy generation sources. Several studies have identified two approaches to lower the levelised cost of electricity: 
reduce the cost over the device's lifetime or increase its overall electrical energy production. Several advanced control strategies have been 
developed to address the latter. However, only a few take into account the overall efficiency of the power take-off (PTO) system, and none of
them solve the optimisation problem that arises at each sampling time on real-time. In this paper, a detailed Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)
approach based on the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme is presented, and the controller performance is evaluated using a time-domain hydrodynamics model (WEC-Sim).
The proposed control law incorporates the PTO system's efficiency in a control law to maximise the energy extracted. The study also revealed that RTI-NMPC clearly 
outperforms a simple resistive controller.
