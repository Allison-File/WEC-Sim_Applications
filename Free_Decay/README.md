# Free Decay - IEA OES Task 10 Sphere

**Author:**	Fabian Wendt

**Version:**	WEC-Sim v2.2

**Geometry:**	Sphere

Example using WEC-Sim to simulate [free decay](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#decay-tests) of a sphere in heave, using [Multiple Condition Runs](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/advanced_features.html#multiple-condition-runs-mcr). This case was developed for IEA OES Task 10 internalation comparison of numerical simulations to experimental data. Execute the `runFreeDecay.m` script to run this case.
